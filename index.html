          <h3>Computer programming and coding</h3>
          <p class="code-skill-description">I studied programming languages in college and found them very interesting and attractive, so I decided to continue my journey, and I still practice even after graduation. I've learned several languages, including Javascript, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, C, and C++.</p>

          <h3>Problem solving</h3>
          <p>The first topic I fell in love with was PROBLEM-SOLVINGG, which required problem analysis and resolving it in the best way possible, it is a way to challenge your mind in, it certainly requires a lot of effort, but it used to be very awesome to me.</p>

        <h3>AI Solution in Smart Farm</h3>
        <img class="pic3" src="images/project.jfif" alt="">
        <p>The core idea of our project is about Suitable irrigation system usage, which is important for maintaining appropriate water
          content and avoiding a water deficit. As a result, this automatic plant watering and soil moisture monitoring system, which is
           especially effective in all climatic conditions, can be used. It is an essential aspect of Jordanian life, especially for farmers.</p></div>

  <p class="code-skill-description">I was one of the founders of the Improve team. We started to form this team believing in the importance of having a team capable of meeting all the requirements of computer engineering students. We held many events that took place at the university level, and we offered many free classes and study courses. We also provided a beautiful and energetic atmosphere among the students. We contributed to helping those in need scientifically. It was a very nice experience.</p>

  <h3>Hult Prize <span class="between"> (Ambassador)</span></h3>
  <p>I applied for a hult prize interview and was accepted as an ambassador after capturing their attention during the zoom meeting. Unfortunately, there was a problem in the company that year, and they had to halt international operations. As a result, I did not collaborate extensively with the team.</p>
